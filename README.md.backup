## Project Title
### Non Adaptive Partial Image Encryption
#### Developers

#### Proposed Scheme
<p> A chaos based symmetric key partial encryptio of 8 bit/pixel grayscale image has been proposed. An original image is first decomposed into its 8 binary bitplanes among which the significant ones are <em>non-adaptively</em> determined. The significant bitplanes are encrypted with the key stream generated by a <em>"Cross Coupled Chaotic random bit Generator"</em> and then combined with the uncrypted ones to from the cipher image. Performance of the technique is verified bt tests based on image statistics- Key sensitive and impermeability of cipher image.
